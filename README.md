# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
With Python and Pandas involved, Omar and I have created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and with Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We have results summarizing how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
![Pyber Fare Summary](https://github.com/rjchiang/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
Based on the summary DataFrame and the multiple-line chart, it seems Urban has the most opportunities with ride-sharing as well as total weekly fares, with Suburban coming in second, and Rural third. As shown in the line graph above, the highest peak shared between the city types appears to be near the end of February.

## Summary
It would seem there are huge disparities among the city types in regards to ride sharing. We should provide oportunities for the rural areas due to the lack of transportation there. Another recommendation would be to repurpose some parts of ride sharing for other business areas such as food delivery. Final recommendation is to provide training, with urban being the highest priorty and suburban second.
